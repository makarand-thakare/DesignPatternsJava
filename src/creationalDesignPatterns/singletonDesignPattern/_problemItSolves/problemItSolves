let's say, there is a class whose object creation is resource intensive or
we need only one instance of some class in the whole project.
then one way we can do it is:
Create object of that class once and then pass it around wherever we need it.


but when using Singleton design pattern,
we don't have to worry about creating or using multiple objects of same class,
or pass and track any object around.

also creation of object becomes thread safe in multithreaded environment.
