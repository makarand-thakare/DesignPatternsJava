Similar to the Factory pattern, this pattern goes one level deeper.

Say you need AircraftVehicleFactory objects. and you created AircraftVehicleFactory objects,
all over your project.
Now because of some requirement you need to update the process of building a AircraftVehicleFactory object.
Then you will have to go to all the places and do it one by one.

but if you use Abstract Factory Pattern, you just have to update the process in the FactoryProvider.
