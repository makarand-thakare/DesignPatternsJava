Firstly- Say you need car objects. and you created car objects, all over your project.
Now because of some requirement you need to update the process of building a car.
Then you will have to go to all the places and do it one by one.

but if you use factory pattern, you just have to update the process in the Factory.

2. If you don't use interface then you have to expose the classes to the client,
who have the same behaviour.

so, by using interface, we can reveal object's programming interface without revealing its class.
