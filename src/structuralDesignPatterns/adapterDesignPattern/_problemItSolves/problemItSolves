Let's say we are getting some class object from some method
BUT the method/system which client has, doesn't accept that,
so we convert/adapt the received object into what we need.

so we don't have to modify the object providing method
(which could be form legacy code or 3rd party library)

In short, adapter makes two incompatible programs compatible.
